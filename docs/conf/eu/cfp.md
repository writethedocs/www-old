## Call for Proposals

We are accepting proposals for our 2015
conference, which is happening on **August 31 - September 1, 2015** in Prague, Czech Republic.

The deadline for submitting your proposal is **Midnight CET on May 31**.

## Conference Goals

Write the Docs is an event for anyone who cares about documentation and
wants to gather and learn from like-minded people, no matter their
personal or professional background. Whether you're a tech writer,
programmer, designer, support technician, or something else entirely,
come and share your tips, tricks, experiences, ideas, frustrations,
hopes, and anything else that your passion for documentation inspires
you to bring to the table.

Come be a part of this fantastic multi-disciplinary gathering of
documentation artisans. 

## Topic Ideas

Although the general focus of Write the Docs is on documentation,
there's a strong emphasis on the software industry. Within that thematic
scope, we love having wide-ranging content that will stretch people in
new directions.

We encourage all levels to submit a talk.
We welcome first-time speakers as well as experienced.
Talking about how things affect beginners or from a beginner point of view 
is just as important as a deep dive into a specific topic.

Some of our favorite talks are ones that make people see the world in a new way.
Teaching entirely new ideas to others can be magical, and we are always
delighted with the breadth of knowledge that our community brings together.

We love talks that deliver hard-earned knowledge based on real-world
experience and research. Whether it's a story about spreading the
documentarian gospel in your company, or tips and tricks for writing,
come share it with people who are eager to know.

We believe that tech writing and documentation don't always get the respect and
consideration they deserve. Come share the problems with documentation your
company overcame, or how you ensure documentation is an organizational priority.

Below are some talks from past events that we feel really captured the
spirit of Write the Docs:

## Presentation format

Presentations will be 30 minutes long. If you have specific length needs
for your presentation, let us know and we can work with it.

## Speaker Benefits and Logistics

If you are selected to speak at Write the Docs, we will waive your
attendance fee. We regret that we are not able to cover the cost of
travel or lodging for speakers at this time. By not covering travel
costs for our speakers, we are able to keep ticket prices low and to
make the conference accessible to the largest number of participants
possible. If your proposal is accepted but you are unable to attend due
to travel costs, however, please let us know and we will do what we can
to help out.

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to participate in the
conference. Additionally, all those who submit a proposal but are not
selected to speak will be able to register at the early bird
registration price.

Proposal decisions will be sent by the middle of June.
