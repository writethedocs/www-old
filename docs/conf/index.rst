Conferences
===========

**Write the Docs Conferences** are focused on documentation systems,
tech writing theory, and information delivery. We consider everyone
who cares about communication and documentation and their users to be a
member of our community. This can be programmers, tech writers, customer
support, marketers, and anyone else who wants people to have great
experiences with software.

Our conferences create a time and a place for the global community of
documentarians to share information, discuss ideas, and work together to
improve the art and science of documentation.
