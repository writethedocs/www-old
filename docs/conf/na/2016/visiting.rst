Visiting Portland
=================

Wondering where to stay and how to get around once you get into
Portland? The conference will be held at the `Crystal
Ballroom <http://www.mcmenamins.com/CrystalBallroom>`__, in downtown
Portland, and most conference events will be held within just a few
blocks of the Crystal Ballroom.

Eating
------

Portland is an amazing food city. Here are some resources that will help
you find something good to eat:

-  The `Easter
   38 <http://pdx.eater.com/maps/best-portland-restaurants-38>`__ is a
   great resource for delightful food.
-  Willamette Week's `Restaurant
   Guide <http://www.wweek.com/portland/restaurantguide>`__
-  Urban Spoon's `Best of
   Portland <http://www.urbanspoon.com/c/24/Portland-restaurants.html>`__
-  `Food Carts Portland <http://www.foodcartsportland.com/>`__

Where to stay
-------------

We are not working with any of the hotels for attendee accommodations,
but there are many hotels available within walking distance of the
venue:

-  `Crystal Hotel <http://www.mcmenamins.com/CrystalHotel>`__
-  `Ace Hotel <http://www.acehotel.com/portland>`__

How to get around
-----------------

Portland is a very accessible city and there are many transportation
options available, public and otherwise.

The MAX
~~~~~~~

The `MAX <http://trimet.org/max>`__ is Portland's major light-rail
system. The MAX primarily connects Portland with the surrounding cities,
such as Gresham, Beaverton, Clackamas, and Hillsboro.

If you're flying into Portland Airport (PDX), we recommend taking the
MAX into downtown Portland. There is a MAX station for the `red
line <http://trimet.org/schedules/maxredline.htm>`__ in the airport
itself. The closest red line stop to the Crystal Ballroom is the
Galleria SW 10th stop.

The Streetcar and Buses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For getting around within and around downtown Portland, the
`Streetcar <http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/>`__ can be a good option.
Portland also has an extensive `bus network <http://trimet.org/bus/>`__.

Taxi Companies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Portland just got Lyft or Uber, but they are somewhat unreliable. There
are several reliable local taxi companies:

-  `Radio Cab <http://www.radiocab.net/>`__
-  `Broadway Cab <http://www.broadwaycab.com/>`__
-  `Portland Taxi <http://portlandtaxi.net/>`__

Please note that it is *not* common to hail taxis in Portland, and that
your best bet is to call in advance.

Bike Rentals
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two bike rental companies in downtown Portland that may be
good options if you want to experience Portland by bike (which we very
much recommend!):

-  `Waterfront Bikes <http://www.waterfrontbikes.com/>`__
-  `Cycle Portland <http://www.portlandbicycletours.com/>`__
