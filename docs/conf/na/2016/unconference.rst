Unconference
============

As part of last year's conference, we held an
`unconference <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference>`__ downstairs
from the main stage, in Lola's Room. These sessions provided an outlet
for the community to share ideas and discuss problems at a deeper level
than we could on just the main stage of the conference.

This year, we will be repeating the unconference track, with the
addition of some scheduled topics to help guide talk sessions.

If you've never attended an unconference, expect to interact closely
with others from the community. Anyone from the community can suggest
and lead a session on a topic, which could be a presentation, a group
discussion on a particular problem, or anything in between.

Leading a Session
-----------------

There is no stage in an unconference, talks instead focus on community
interaction. While standard presentations can work, the format lends
better to discussions within your group.

Whether you have a topic in mind, or maybe just a problem you would like
to pose to the rest of the community, there is no wrong way to lead an
unconference session. Here are a few ideas of how to structure your
session, borrowed from `Scott Berkun's post on unconference
sessions <http://scottberkun.com/2006/how-to-run-a-great-unconference-session/>`__:

-  **Group discussion** - Pick a topic and facilitate a group discussion
-  **The semi-talk** - Use a short presentation to lead into a group
   discussion on a topic
-  **Show and tell** - Show off your latest project, a new tool, or
   anything else you are excited about
-  **Presentation** - Because sessions are meant to be small and
   inclusive, this is a difficult format to lead a session with. You
   cannot rely on slides, because you will not have a screen to present
   with. Feel free to present a longer talk, but expect more interaction
   from others joining the session and break often for questions and
   discussion

Schedule a Session
------------------

Attendees that wish to lead an unconference session have several options
for signing up. We will have a board with all of the sessions for the
unconference track each day, simply post your talk topic on the board if
you would like to speak.

The first chance you will get to post your presentation is on Sunday, at
our Writing Day event and preregistration party. 
If you don't make it to the Writing Day event or preregistration party,
be sure to head to Lola's Room when you first arrive at the conference
to post your topic.

We will start promoting the unconference sessions early in the day on
the days of the conference, so be sure to post your topic early.

Sessions
--------

Unconference sessions will begin after lunch both days, running until
the end of the day. We will start the unconference sessions off each day
with some time for focus on one of several topics:
