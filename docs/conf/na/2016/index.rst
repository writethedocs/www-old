Thanks!
=======

Thanks to everyone who made this year another wonderful event.
We're so grateful to our sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and attendees for making the conference possible. 

We have posted the `videos <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmV2D6sIiX3U03qc-FPXgLFGFkccCEtfv>`_ and `photos <https://www.flickr.com/photos/writethedocs/albums/72157669467964085>`_ from the conference for those who couldn't attend. 
Hopefully they allow you to bask in the beauty of the event from the comfort of your own chair.

We hope you'll join us in `Prague <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2016/>`_ in September,
or again in Portland next year!

About the conference
====================

We invite you to join 400 other folks for a three-day event to explore the art and science of
documentation. The conference covers any topic related to documentation
in the software industry. Past talks
have also covered such diverse topics as empathy, the history of math symbols,
and using emoji to keep your users' attention.

Write the Docs brings *everyone* who writes the docs together in the
same room: Writers, Developers, Support Folks. We all have things to
learn from each other, and there's no better way than sitting together
and talking.

The main presentation track takes place from **May 23-24 (Monday and
Tuesday) from 9am to 6pm**. We will return to the historic `Crystal
Ballroom <http://www.mcmenamins.com/CrystalBallroom>`_, `centrally
located <http://goo.gl/maps/D2WrJ>`_ in the heart of Portland. During
the main event we also run a :doc:`/conf/na/2016/unconference`,
downstairs in Lola's Room.

You can find out more information about the venue and its accessibility on our :doc:`/conf/na/2016/venue` page.

Schedule
--------

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Each year we organize a wide
bunch of events so that people can join together, collaborate, and learn
from each other.

This year, we have events planned all day on Sunday, the day before the
conference, and our annual hike will take
place on Saturday afternoon. Our Sunday events include our Writing
Day documentation sprints during the
day, and our conference reception in the evening.

The main conference event will be held May 23-24th, during the day. We
will be holding unconference sessions
after lunch both days of the events, downstairs from the main stage, in
Lola's Room. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to join in on the unconference.

You can see the full schedule on the :doc:`/conf/na/2016/schedule` page.
