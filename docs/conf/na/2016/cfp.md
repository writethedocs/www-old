## CALL FOR PROPOSALS

Good day, documentarians! We’re excited to announce that we’re officially accepting talk proposals for our 2016 conference, coming up on **May 22-24, 2016** in Portland, Oregon.

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience. Whether you’ve been writing documentation for decades or you’ve just started this year, we want to hear from you! Read on to learn more about the goals of the conference and what we look for in talk proposals.

In the meantime, mark your calendars: The deadline for submitting proposals is **Midnight PST on February 29, 2016**.


## CONFERENCE GOALS

The purpose of Write the Docs is to bring together people who are passionate about documentation and give them an opportunity to interact with and learn from their peers. One of the defining characteristics of our community is the broad range of professional backgrounds we hail from—and our conference seeks to celebrate that. Whether you are a tech writer, programmer, designer, support technician, or something else entirely, we want to hear from you. Bring us your tips, tricks, experiences, ideas, frustrations, hopes, or anything else that your passion for documentation inspires you to share.  

## WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR

Although the focus of Write the Docs is on documentation, particularly within the software industry, we aim for a wide range of talks that will stretch people in new directions. We’re after talks that deliver a fresh perspective on or a demonstrate creative approach to writing the docs.

We encourage people all levels to submit talks. First-time speakers are great. Experienced speakers are great. Hearing the perspective of a novice documentarian can be just as valuable as a deep-dive into a specific topic.

Some of our favorite talks are ones that make people see the world in a new way. Bringing in ideas from totally different disciplines can be magical, and we are always delighted with the breadth of knowledge that our community brings together.

We also love talks that deliver hard-earned knowledge based on real-world experience and research. Whether it's a story about spreading the documentarian gospel in your company, or a compilation of tips and tricks for better technical writing, we want you to come and share it with people who can put it to good use.

We believe that tech writing and documentation don't always get the respect and consideration they deserve. Come discuss the documentation challenges your company has overcome, or the strategies you use to make sure documentation is an organizational priority.

Below are some talks from past events that we feel really captured the spirit of Write the Docs:

## PRESENTATION FORMAT

Presentations will be 30 minutes long. If you have specific length needs for your presentation, let us know and we can work with it.

## SPEAKER BENEFITS & LOGISTICS

If you are selected to speak at Write the Docs, we will waive your attendance fee. We regret that we are not able to cover the cost of travel or lodging for speakers at this time. By not covering travel costs for our speakers, we are able to keep ticket prices low and to make the conference accessible to the largest number of participants possible. If your proposal is accepted but you are unable to attend due to travel costs, however, please let us know and we will do what we can to help out.

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to participate in the conference. Additionally, all those who submit a proposal but are not selected to speak will be able to register at the early bird registration price.

Finally, you’ll hear from us with our proposal decisions by the middle of March.
