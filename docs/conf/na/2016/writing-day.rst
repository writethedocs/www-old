Writing Day
-----------

This year, Write the Docs will have a new Writing Day, modeled after the
concept of
`sprints <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_%28software_development%29>`__
from the open source world. The idea is simple: to get a bunch of
interesting people in a room together and have them work towards shared
goals.

To make the most out of the Writing Day, we recommend that you either
come with a project, or be ready and willing to contribute to someone
else's project.

Here are some examples of projects that you might want to work on:

-  Open source software documentation
-  General documentation writing
-  Best practices manual (For your company, or the world)
-  Blog posts
-  Tips and tricks
-  Great works of fiction
-  Love letters
-  The Documentarian Manifesto

You get the idea.

All this adds up to a room full of smart people sharing your problems,
your passion, and your goals. So be ready to learn some new things and
to teach others what you know.

Even if you `feel <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome>`__ as
though you don't know that much, we know you have a lot to offer. Come
surprise yourself with how much you can share.

Logistics
^^^^^^^^^

Please bring a computer or some other mechanism with which to create
written words.

We'll be creating and editing content, so make sure that you have the
tools you need to contribute.

Documenting a new project?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check out our `beginners
guide <http://docs.writethedocs.org/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/>`__
to writing documentation. This should help you get started, and give you
some ideas for how you can contribute to a projet that you love.

Projects
^^^^^^^^

We have some suggestions for projects that you can work on during the
Writing Day. If you'd like to add your own project to the list, you can
`email us <mailto:conf@writethedocs.org>`__. Better yet, `submit a pull
request <https://github.com/writethedocs/www/blob/master/docs/conf/na/2015/writing-day.md>`__.

`Open News <http://opennews.org/blog/code-convening-wtd/>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Open News team has multiple open source journalism projects whose
documentation could use some expert love. Help improve the docs on some
amazing code that helps people understand the news everyday.

Check out the `full
list <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8D_757jFZEE0GLc-1eXUyqbuQ7Km5GkKMHIjK6NxoI/edit?usp=sharing>`__
of Open News projects that will be worked on.

`Mozilla Developer Network <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Help document the internet. Mozilla always needs more people to create,
edit, and translate content, so we can do more to help make the internet
more approachable.

`WordPress <https://wordpress.org/>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

WordPress powers a large portion of the internet. Help write the docs
that help people set it up and use it.

`Write the Docs Website <http://www.writethedocs.org>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

We have a website for our community, but it kinda sucks. Help us make it
better by adding content, archiving old talks and notes, or just making
it more friendly in general. Remember, you *are* the community.

`Write the Docs Guide <http://docs.writethedocs.org/>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

A guide to writing documentation. Help us make this guide great for
people who want to write docs, but don't know where to start.

RAML-based API generator
''''''''''''''''''''''''

I’m working on the API Reference for a new web service. I have all of
the APIs defined in a RAML file, which also allows me to use the same
source to generate the documentation. Ideally, I’d also like to make the
API reference interactive. As examples, see
http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html#!/account,
https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs or
http://developer.marvel.com/docs.

Let's work together to make this happen at the Writing Day!

NodeSchool Workshops/Events Docs
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

There are around 30 `NodeSchool <http://nodeschool.io/>`__ tutorials,
and each one is it's own special snowflake. They are also viewed in the
terminal, which isn't the most user friendly way to read docs. We want
to figure some nice ways to write docs that can work in both the CLI as
well as on the web. One example of a workshop that has done this is
``git-it`` which generates `this HTML
guide <http://jlord.us/git-it/>`__.

Also there is a `NodeSchool International
Day <http://nodeschool.io/international-day/>`__ event coming up with
events in 30+ cities and we wanna write a Guide for Organizers and a
Guide for Attendees so they can get the most out of their events.

Your Project Here
'''''''''''''''''

Yup. We know you need better docs. We do too. Make it happen.

Send us an email or pull request with your project and a short paragraph
about what you need help with, and we'll include it here.
