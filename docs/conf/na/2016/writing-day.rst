Writing Day
-----------

This year, Write the Docs will have a new Writing Day, modeled after the
concept of
`sprints <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_%28software_development%29>`__
from the open source world. The idea is simple: to get a bunch of
interesting people in a room together and have them work towards shared
goals.

To make the most out of the Writing Day, we recommend that you either
come with a project, or be ready and willing to contribute to someone
else's project.

Here are some examples of projects that you might want to work on:

-  Open source software documentation
-  General documentation writing
-  Best practices manual (For your company, or the world)
-  Blog posts
-  Tips and tricks
-  Great works of fiction
-  Love letters
-  The Documentarian Manifesto

You get the idea.

All this adds up to a room full of smart people sharing your problems,
your passion, and your goals. So be ready to learn some new things and
to teach others what you know.

Even if you `feel <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome>`__ as
though you don't know that much, we know you have a lot to offer. Come
surprise yourself with how much you can share.

Logistics
^^^^^^^^^

Please bring a computer or some other mechanism with which to create
written words.

We'll be creating and editing content, so make sure that you have the
tools you need to contribute.
