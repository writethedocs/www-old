Starting a Meetup
=================

Interested in fostering a lovely gathering of documentarians in your neck of the woods?
This is the place to start!

The first thing you'll want to do is watch this video about starting a meetup.
It contains a lot of the knowledge that we have put here:

Write the Docs Worldview
------------------------

Our worldview is important for starting a meetup.
We aren't just another tech writing meetup,
but hope to be welcoming to the vast parts of the tech industry that care about documentation.

Eric Holscher's Introduction to the conference and community from the Write the Docs 2016 event in Portland is a good place to start.
We highly recommend watching this before starting a meetup!

.. note:: You can skip ahead to 1:30, since the beginning is mostly conference logistics.

Done? Let's go into details.

Launch your meetup page
-----------------------

`Meetup <http://www.meetup.com/>`_ is a web service that helps you organize regular events. It costs money but will make your life as an organizer much easier: you'll be able to create events with registration, easily contact people in you group, promote your sponsors, etc. Feel free to use another service if Meetup doesn't meet your needs.

How to launch your group?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use Meetup, go to their `website <https://secure.meetup.com/create/>`_ and follow the instructions.

a few tips:

* **Topics**: they're keywords associated with your group that will help people find it. If you're not sure what to choose, you can try: Technical Writers, Documentation, Technical Writing, Technical communicators, Technical Documentation Editing, Writing, Document Management Systems, Software Development, Web Development, User Experience, UX Design, Open Source.
* **Name**: our meetups are usually called "Write the Docs" + city name.
* **Members' name**: meetup's organizers usually choose "Documentarians".
* **Code of Conduct**: don't forget to add Write the Docs' :doc:`/code-of-conduct` to the ``page`` section of your meetup.

If you need more help, you can check `Meetup's documentation <http://www.meetup.com/help/topics/10/article/464982/>`_.

When you're done, `contact us <mailto:writethedocs@gmail.com>`_: we will add your group to the :doc:`/meetups/index` list on our website.

    How to find a place to meet and sponsors?
    -----------------------------------------

    How to find sponsors?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Try these places at the beginning to find sponsors:

    * Your company, 
    * Software companies in your town
    * Look who sponsors other meetups or events, 

    A basic sales pitch: new knowledge for them and their employees, can advertise about job offer, etc.

    Got a place: what now?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Logistic (wifi, power outlet, projector and mac adaptors, arrive early).

    If food: always offer vegetarian option. If beverages: always offer non alcoholic choice.

    Accessibility

    Can't find a free place to meet?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    go to a park, restaurant, etc: adapt your event accordingly.


    How to reach new members?
    -------------------------

    Create social media accounts. Advertise your next meetup on WTD slack, forum or mailing list.
    Go to other meetups to present yours.

    Go to company booth during events to tell them about your meetup.

    Don't forget to ask if people want to help you: organizing alone can be really hard and time-consuming.

    What to do during a meetup?
    ---------------------------

    Talks. Multiple formats: 20 minutes, 40 minutes, lightning talks, etc.
    Talk proposal preparation.
    Networking.
    Learning new skills/tools.
    If you want to find a list of topics: check other `WTD meetups <http://meetup.com/pro/writethedocs>`_.

    How to find speakers?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Look at previous conferences, meetup around you.
    CFP: invite your members to talk!
