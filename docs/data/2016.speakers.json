This year I'd like to tell the rest of a story, which is some of the most exciting work I've done in my career. I'll talk about the process of creating and growing a writing culture which is technically accurate, writes with a human voice, and connects to every other part of the information experience. While talking everyone through the journey I'll be sure to cover specific examples of using content strategy, user research, data analytics and a touch of team process. All this with a bit of humor and a passion which is obvious to anyone who's ever met me.</p>\n<p>Main points I'll touch on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How we worked through resistance to change.</li>\n<li>What Information Experience means to us and why it's not just a fancy title.</li>\n<li>Moving from the Quality Assistance team to the Design team win's, frustrations, hopes.</li>\n<li>Building a better site with Confluence and considering/using other tools.

Using the writing process developed by Peter Elbow, author of \u201cWriting without Teachers,\u201d I\u2019ll show how to conduct peer reviews that elicit the reader\u2019s subjective experience -- what Peter Elbow called \u201cmovies of the reader\u2019s mind\u201d -- to reveal the ambiguities that can plague our writing.

We use that data to make dynamic decisions that affect our site and our docs work, influencing everything from quick doc fixes, giant rewrites, and our own site\u2019s functionality.</p>\n<p>Every pertinent comment receives attention from at least one tech writer. Part of our code example is out of date? Fixed. There\u2019s a glitch on our site? We\u2019ll look into it. We list a version of Mongo that\u2019s outdated? Updated. By focusing on these comments, your audience is working with you to keep your documentation updated. </p>\n<p>What happens when a customer doesn\u2019t leave a comment, and just says the document wasn\u2019t helpful? We track that too. When docs have consistently negative feedback without constructive comments, we know that at least something in that doc needs work. When that happens, we work with SMEs to rewrite those docs and give them a little love. We polish \u2018em up and publish them again, tracking their data afterwards to make sure that they\u2019re indeed improved.  </p>\n<p>And this doesn\u2019t just benefit the Docs team. We\u2019ve forwarded UI complaints to design, and disgruntled customer comments to Support. That\u2019s part of the beauty of CSAT: it\u2019s a direct line to all the customers looking for help with our products. With CSAT, our audience is helping us to curate the best possible information for all their needs.</p>\n<p>But we\u2019re not stopping there. Soon, we\u2019ll be implementing OAuth for our CSAT data. Once that\u2019s enabled, we\u2019ll be able to see what specific products customers are using, what region they\u2019re in, what type of user permissions they have, and a ton of other stuff. We\u2019ll be positively swimming in audience connectedness from our CSAT, and with it, we\u2019ll know that our audience is understanding our concise information in the best way possible. </p>"

In this talk, Tina the Tech Writer is back, now leading a team of writers. The team has been almost <em>too</em> successful at proving the value of documentation. Facing a mountain of urgent requests for documentation coverage, potential writer burnout, and attrition, she puts her hedgehog brain skills to practical application on a plan to bring the team to new levels of engagement, happiness, and value -- all while learning to say no when appropriate. It's all about balance. Tina will share results from her team's experiment, while outlining a way you can design your own plan to balance any set of challenges and opportunities you're facing. </p>"
