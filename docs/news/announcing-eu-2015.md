# Announcing Write the Docs EU 2015

We are excited to announce the dates for the 2015 EU conference!

* [Write the Docs Europe](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/) will be 
in **Prague, Czech Republic on August 31 - September 1, 2015.**
* The conference will be held at **Klub Lavka** in the Praha 1 historical city center.

### Conference

Join us for a two-day event to explore the art and science of documentation.
You can look forward to learning more about documentation systems, tech writing theory, information delivery, and more.
Past talks have also covered such diverse topics as typography, empathy, and [Wabi-sabi][wabisabi].

The main event takes place on August 31 - September 1 (Monday and Tuesday) from 9am to 6pm.
Our venue, [Klub Lavka][klub-lavka], sits right [on the bank of the Charles river](https://goo.gl/maps/OHjne), 
overlooking the Charles bridge.

### Auxiliary Events

Write the Docs is more than a conference.
Each year we organize other events so that people can get to know each other better.
These events are optional, but we strongly recommend you come into town Saturday or early Sunday to participate.

This year, those events will include:

* City tour (Saturday Afternoon) --- Join us for a walking tour of the old city center around the beautiful and historical sights that Prague has to offer.
* Conference Reception (Sunday Night) --- Come early, get your badge, and get to know other attendees.
* Official Party (Monday Night) --- Wind down and talk about the day's talks in a relaxed and friendly environment.

### Keep in Touch

Early-bird tickets are on sale and the call for proposals is open!
If you wish to receive more information as it becomes available, sign up for [our mailing list][mailing-list] or follow us on Twitter at [@writethedocs][twitter].

If you are interested in sponsorship, please [send us an email][email-us].

### Conclusion

We are excited to be return to Europe for our second year!
This year promises to be a fantastic experience for writers, programmers, designers, and all those who write the docs.

Start gathering your ideas and getting excited about another year of great talks and conversations.
