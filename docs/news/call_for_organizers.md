Hi all,

You're receiving this email because you expressed interest in helping organize a Write the Docs NA conference on the East Coast in 2017. It contains information about the location and venue the organizers have considered, and a summary of what to expect from helping to organize. I realize that only one or two of you live in the DC area -- remote organization can also work, but it takes some additional planning and it will help if you have some familiarity with the DC area. Said familiarity is not required, but if you don't know DC, it could affect the organizer roles that make sense for you to assume.

LOCATION AND VENUE

Jennifer Rondeau, co-organizer of WTD NA in Portland for two years now, recently moved to DC, and is willing to be organizer in chief on the ground, so the DC area might make the most sense. Eric Holscher, original founder of WTD NA, also has family in the DC area and has already looked into this possibility for a venue:

I'll be visiting this week, meeting with the owner and event coordinator, and I'll report back in a separate email. A few things to note, though:

* The venue is already set up to host conferences, unlike the Crystal Ballroom in Portland. This means that we don't need to worry about setting up wifi or taping down power cables -- big wins!

WHAT TO EXPECT FROM HELPING ORGANIZE: WHAT WE DO

* Communication. This means emails announcing the CFP and registration, reminders, and emails specifically for speakers, volunteers, (and others?). This material is already in place in GitHub for previous years and venues, but always needs to be updated with current and local information.

* Production of designed materials. (Jennifer will probably handle this if we have items produced locally.)

* Review of proposals. With three conferences possibly being held in the same year, the current organizers are still brainstorming how we might encourage speakers to speak at more than one WTD conference in the same year, but you should still expect to review 50-60 proposals to help whittle the list down to 20 or so. (check numbers).

* Setting up for Writing Day

* Helping sponsors set up

ORGANIZER ROLES

* Speaker wrangler

* Volunteer coordinator

* Unconf wrangler (low key)

WHAT TO EXPECT FROM HELPING ORGANIZE: WHAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

* Swag, signs, t-shirts -- designs only. The designs will be shared across all 2017 conferences (with adjustments for individual locations)

* If we go with the State Theatre: anything catering-related. They require us to use their catering service.
