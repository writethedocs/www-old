Hi all,

You're receiving this email because you expressed interest in helping organize a Write the Docs NA conference on the East Coast in 2017. It contains information about the location and venue the organizers have considered, and a summary of what to expect from helping to organize. I realize that only one or two of you live in the DC area -- remote organization can also work, but it takes some additional planning and it will help if you have some familiarity with the DC area. Said familiarity is not required, but if you don't know DC, it could affect the organizer roles that make sense for you to assume.

LOCATION AND VENUE

Jennifer Rondeau, co-organizer of WTD NA in Portland for two years now, recently moved to DC, and is willing to be organizer in chief on the ground, so the DC area might make the most sense. Eric Holscher, original founder of WTD NA, also has family in the DC area and has already looked into this possibility for a venue:

[State Theatre, Falls Church, VA](http://www.thestatetheatre.com/index.xml)

I visited a couple of weeks ago and met with the owner and event coordinator. I'm still waiting on a quote from the coordinator for the total cost, which at the moment is planned to cover two shorter days (10am to 4pm Monday-Tuesday in early October). I'll let you know when I have more information. We've been asked, though, to decide on dates by the end of summer 2016.

* The venue is already set up to host conferences, unlike the Crystal Ballroom in Portland. This means that we don't need to worry about setting up wifi or taping down power cables -- big wins!

WHAT TO EXPECT FROM HELPING ORGANIZE: WHAT WE DO

* Communication. This means emails announcing the CFP and registration, reminders, and emails specifically for speakers, volunteers, (and others?). This material is already in place in GitHub for previous years and venues, but always needs to be updated with current and local information.

* Production of designed materials. (Jennifer will probably handle this if we have items produced locally.)

* Review of proposals. With three conferences possibly being held in the same year, the current organizers are still brainstorming how we might encourage speakers to speak at more than one WTD conference in the same year, but you should still expect to review 50-60 proposals to help whittle the list down to 20 or so.

* Setting up for Writing Day

* Helping sponsors set up

ORGANIZER ROLES

See [this page](http://organizer-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/confs/organizers.html) of the organizer manual.

WHAT TO EXPECT FROM HELPING ORGANIZE: WHAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

* Swag, signs, t-shirts -- designs only. The designs will be shared across all 2017 conferences (with adjustments for individual locations)

* If we go with the State Theatre: anything catering-related. They require us to use their catering service. This means that they handle everything: food, booze, non-alcoholic beverages, setup, and breakdown.
